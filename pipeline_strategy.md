## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA phase provides insights into the dataset, including statistical summaries and visualizations. This step helps in understanding the distribution of features, relationships between variables, and the extent of missing data.

---

## Data Imputation

In this phase, missing data is handled using various techniques, such as mean, median, or advanced imputation methods. This ensures the dataset is complete and ready for model training.

---

## Baseline Model

A baseline model is created to establish a point of comparison for more advanced models. This simple model helps measure whether more complex models improve classification performance.

---

## Bayesian Optimization for Hyperparameter Tuning

Bayesian optimization is used to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the chosen model. This approach helps in improving the model's performance by selecting the optimal set of parameters.

---

## Model Creation

This section focuses on building machine learning models such as Random Forest, XGBoost, or Neural Networks. The models are trained using the dataset, with hyperparameters set via Bayesian optimization.

---

## Model Evaluation

The trained models are evaluated using various performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC. These metrics provide insights into the model's effectiveness in classifying prostate cancer patients.

---

## Results

This section summarizes the results of the model, highlighting key performance metrics, important features, and insights gained from the analysis. It may also discuss any limitations or areas for further improvement.
